# DRUG-RESPONSE-PREDICTION

 Overview
This project predicts cancer patients' responses to drugs using machine learning models, specifically logistic regression and random forest. The goal is to improve precision medicine by personalizing treatment plans.

 Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, encode, and normalize cancer drug data.
- **Modeling:** Develop logistic regression and random forest models.
- **Evaluation:** Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Application:** Create a user-friendly interface for predictions.

 Dataset
The **PANCANCER ANOVA Preprocessed** dataset includes features like drug targets, pathways, and IC50 values.

 Results
- Logistic regression achieved ~80.06% accuracy.
- Random forest performed slightly better, capturing complex interactions.
  
 Conclusion
Both models show promise in predicting drug efficacy, with random forest offering better performance. Future work will focus on larger datasets and advanced models.
